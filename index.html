              <h2>Sales by Day of Week (Jan 2016)</h2>
              <img src="Average%20Units%20Sold%20by%20Day%20(All%20Regions).png"></img>
              <p>
                  The daily sales show some interesting trends. 
                  The weekdays are more popular for all items and we observe
                  a universal trough in sales from Friday to Sunday. This does 
                  appear to be with the exception, however, of fish filets on 
                  Friday being as popular, if not more popular than the other days.
                  It's probable that this is due to Catholics giving up meat on Fridays
                  (often during Lent, but they might engage the habit regardless).

              <h2>Regional Sales Trends</h2>
              <div>
                  <h3>Northwest Region</h3>
                  <img src="Units%20Sold%20(Northwest%20Region).png"></img>
                  <p>
                      The Northwest region saw the quickest plunge in sales of hamburgers 
                      following the release of Burger King's Impossible Burger. Chicken 
                      filet sales also took a dip. We may need more time to gauge where these 
                      numbers will eventually settle, but it should be noted that this 
                      region seems uniquely vulnerable to changing their diets.
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h3>Southwest Region</h3>
                  <img src="Units%20Sold%20(Southwest%20Region).png"></img>
                  <p>
                      The Southwest Region's chart looks generally similar to the Northwest 
                      Region's, with a dip in hambuger and chicken sales in October 2018. 
                      The market for hambugers did seem to recover somewhat more efficiently 
                      than in the Northwest, though. As this region at one point had the 
                      best hamburger sales, it is important that we implement an effective 
                      recovery process.
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h3>Central Region</h3>
                  <img src="Units%20Sold%20(Central%20Region).png"></img>
                  <p>
                      The Central Region is more rigid than the others and seems less 
                        susceptible to change. The chicken sales barely took a dip in 
                        October 2018, and the burger sales' drop was not nearly as drastic 
                        as in other regions.
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h3>Northeast Region</h3>
                  <img src="Units%20Sold%20(Northeast%20Region).png"></img>
                  <p>
                      The Northeast Region's sales saw a quick recovery after October 2018, 
                      but since then sales have at best stagnated and at worse seem to be 
                      slightly declining. In the meantime, chicken filet sales have not 
                      recovered to prior levels and fish filet sales don't seem to be 
                      increasing in its place.
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h3>Southeast Region</h3>
                  <img src="Units%20Sold%20(Southeast%20Region).png"></img>
                  <p>
                      Burger sales in the Southeast Region are particularly dire. They 
                      hardly recovered following the release of the Impossible Burger, 
                      and since then seem to be steadily declining. Chicken and fish filet 
                      sales also seem to be settling into a consistent number, which is not 
                      enough when we are constantly faced with new competition and problems.
                  </p>

              In conclusion, we have found a few important trends by which to direct our 
              marketing campaigns in the coming months. Consumers tend to eat McDonald's 
              sandwiches mostly on weekdays, perhaps when they don't have time to cook at 
              home. To combat this, we might be able to present these meals are ideal 
              to supplement weekend activities. Improved associations with things like 
              beach days, youth sports games, or housekeeping could boost our weekend 
              sales. We should also pay more attention to religious observances. It is 
              clear that the religious population has incredible sway on our sales and 
              any holidays that favor certain meats over others could allow us to 
              predict sales numbers before they occur.
          </p>
          <p>
              Further, we have found that the Northwest and Southwest regions seem 
              especially suspectible to change, so we might want to focus extra advertising  
              in those regions. We really need to find a way of halting the decline of 
              hamburger sales in the Northeast and Central regions, specifically, which 
              have not only not recovered from the release of the Impossible Burger, but 
              are still declining. Chicken sales seem to follow the same trends as 
              hamburgers, so it might be worth an effort to distinguish them in terms of 
              health, environmental impact, or moral consequence of eating meat.
          </p>
          <p>
              I hope these conclusions will be helpful to directing your marketing 
              strategies. Good luck Mr. CEO!
